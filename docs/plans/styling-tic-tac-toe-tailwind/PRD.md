# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Styling Tic-Tac-Toe with Tailwind

## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this task is to enhance the visual presentation of the existing vanilla HTML/JS Tic-Tac-Toe game using Tailwind CSS. The core game logic will remain unchanged, but the UI will be modernized, responsive, and styled with utility classes.

## 2. Features
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling.
- **Modern UI Components**:
  - A clean, centered game board.
  - Consistent typography and color palette.
  - Hover states for board cells.
- **Responsive Layout**: The game should look great on mobile and desktop.
- **Game Status Feedback**: Styled indicators for the current turn (X/O) and game results (Win/Draw).
- **Reset Button Styling**: A clear, prominent button to reset the game state.

## 3. UI/UX Design
- **Theme**: A clean, modern look (e.g., slate or indigo color schemes).
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions for hover and marker appearance.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure high contrast and clear visual cues.

## 4. Technical Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN or local installation).
- **File Structure**: Maintain the separation of concerns (HTML, JS) while integrating Tailwind classes into the HTML structure.
- **Constraints**: No change to the existing game logic unless necessary for class manipulation.

## 5. Success Criteria
- The game is visually appealing and modern.
- All original game logic functions correctly.
- The UI is responsive.
